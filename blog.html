                                    It is incredibly time consuming to maintain even a small amount of digital products on the
                                    web. If you purchase a large quantity of products through wholesale and you want to turn a
                                    profit, exposure online in our technological era is a big help. However, technically inclined,
                                    newfound, entrepreneurs trying to sell large amounts of products have trouble posting them
                                    online in multiple areas. These guys are our target audience, but it's still a common problem for
                                    many small-medium sized businesses as well. Entire businesses exist solely to provide a
                                    solution to this e-commerce problem, but of course they require your credit card information for
                                    their free trial. Therefore we will build our own and distribute it amongst the masses, because
                                    we are computer scientists, and we are in Advanced Web Development taught by Ted
                                    Holmnberg.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We propose to build an ecommerce website where a person can sell any type of product
                                    they want. From the customer’s side, they will be able to add products to their cart and pay
                                    using PayPal’s callback request API. They also can create multiple carts and wish lists and add
                                    products to them. Administrators will be able to add and remove products to the store and
                                    categorize them. Ideally, the admin will also be capable of interfacing with major online
                                    marketplaces, so that their products can be added, removed, and managed from our frontend
                                    for these online markets. By doing this, the administrator can easily manage their products in
                                    one location but still have the advantage of large amounts of traffic.
                                    <br><br>
                                    For the frontend creation, we will use a combination of HTML, Javascript (JS), CSS, and
                                    Bootstrap. The website is an object oriented structured online store with procedural front end
                                    HTML generation done through the DOM using JavaScript. For the design of the website, we
                                    will be using CSS and Bootstrap to make the website look pleasing to the user and responsive.
                                    We want to create an interface that is easy for both the clients and administrators to use and
                                    understand. For the backend, we aren’t entirely sure how to approach it. It’s possible to handle
                                    REST api on a server that can be used to manage a sql database, but perhaps a noSQL
                                    approach will be better, one using XML or JSON. Once we discuss MongoDB more in the class
                                    we may decide to use this approach.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We made the decision to make a ecommerce project is due to Lisa intial idea of making a service where her
                                    photgraher friend can sell her service and book appointments. Then David jump on the ecommerce idea where 
                                    he want to make a wensite where his friend can sell their swords, bows, spears, etc. Instead of publishing the
                                    products on different website such as EBay, Amazon, Esty, etc. , have the users be routed to David's friend website
                                    to the buy the products.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Lisa, David, and I know each other through UNO Game Club. David is a very ambitous in his idea and really put alot of
                                    effort into the project until he thinks it is good in his eyes. As for Lisa, I have not work with her before, but I know
                                    she can draw digital art.

                                    Tic Tac Toe is a 3 by 3 grid game where a player can be either X or O. The player will select a spot on the grid to place either X or O and the winner is
                                    decided by having either a row, column, or diagonal have matching X or O.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The controller.js is the where player can do certain action such as wither clicking on one of
                                    grid to place an X or O. The default first player is X. The other action the player can do is
                                    click the restart button which starts the game in a new state.
                                    Selecting the grid or cells is through using the DOM, querySelectorAll(".cell") and select all the class with the CSS called
                                    cell. The restart button is querySelector() select the CSS with the class restart.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The view.js is what the player can see which are the printing the amount of turns left until
                                    the game ends in a draw. Printing the amount of turns left is through using getElementByID() which gets
                                    the element with the Id of turns. 
                                    Printing what player turn it is, printing the winner, and printing the
                                    ends in a draw. These are using the querySelector() by getting the CSS called status.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The model.js is where the logic of the game happens. There is a function called cellClick(clickedCellEvent) where
                                    the clicked cell is targetted and get the index of the cell. It checks if the cell is blank through a let called
                                    board which is a array with 9 blank spaces. The fuction also decrease the amount of turns by 1, set the selected cell to 
                                    be either X or O, prints the turn, and check the winner. The setCell function is update the board and rewrite the
                                    innerHTML of the clickedCell. The checkWinner function checkRows, checkColumns, checkDiagonals, detect if the player has won or draw,
                                    and changePlayer().

                                    I went to a online career fair and there were three companies that position I can applied
                                    and in New Orleans. The three were StrikerVR, Prokeep, and Performance Software, but I was only
                                    able to attend two of the three. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    The first panel I attend is <a href="https://www.psware.com/">Performance Software</a> and the company deals
                                    with aviation i.e. aircrafts. The recriuter has work there for 3 years after graduating. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    The second panel I attend is <a href="https://www.strikervr.com/">StrikerVR</a> and I heard about them before. I think they did a presentation at
                                    UNO before COVID-19 happen. I could talk to the recruiter through mic but I was able to schedule one for a later data.
                                    StrikerVR works with virtual reality and also involve guns. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    The third panel, <a href="https://www.prokeep.com/">Prokeep</a>, I couldn't attend is due to all three recruiters left before end time of the event.
                                    I still apply for all three of them.

                                    Revival Floor is a scary/horror/creepy pasta type of a story genre.
                                    It was written in HTML present the story using text and images. I use about 15
                                    differnt HTML files for the story because I want the user to navigate between different HTML files.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    I implemented a custom CSS files to style the story. I made the image either small or move it around the page.
                                    I imported custom text font to make the atmosphere scary. Added sounds later to up the creepy factor.
                                    Although it was a story, it was more of an interactive story where the user can interact with the page.
                                    I had implement some JavaScripts to make all the HTML more interactive.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    I made it so that you can click buttons to change images, other HTML pages are locked until user
                                    posses a certain item, and keeping track of items the user will find throughout the story.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    You can play Revival Floor <a href="projects.html" class="tooltip-test " title="Revival Floor">here</a>
